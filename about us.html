<background></background>
<h3  style="color: white;">The journey of Wellspring University has been anything but smooth. Since opening our doors to the public in 2010, the first decade was marked by a series of challenges, ranging from the mundane to the tumultuous. The period from 2020 to 2021 was especially pivotal. The Covid-19 pandemic came with its peculiar challenges in 2020 and in 2021, we lost our library to an electrical fire. The impact of these challenges listed above in addition to existing challenges we were facing put us on the verge of shutting down operations. But against all odds, we navigated through these challenges and survived this period. We embraced our survival as a gift we should not take for granted, and a second chance for a fresh start. This experience led us to reassess our core mission and our reason for existence by asking these three questions;</h3>
<center><h2  style="color: blue;" style="text-align:center;"> Wellspring University Strategic Direction</h2></center>
<h3  style="color: white;">Our attempt to answer these questions led to the launch of the first version of our Strategic Direction in November 2021. You can view it here. The past few years of judiciously following our new vision have shown clear indications that we are on the right track as an institution, as this vision has sparked tremendous growth. The path we travelled can be likened to attending the school of hard knocks and graduating successfully. Our unique story of resilience is a testament to the tough times we endured, which have profoundly shaped our ideology and drive for the future. Our future at Wellspring University holds a lot of promise, for which we are really excited. We are looking forward to having you onboard with us. Start your journey here(apply now).</h3><br>

<h3  style="color: white;">It is evident that for Africa to chart a new course towards prosperity, it must adopt a different approach to its learning. As it becomes imperative to integrate learning systems that would positively build the pan-Africanist worldview.</h3>
