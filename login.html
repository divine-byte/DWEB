<H2 style="color:white;">About Wellspring University</H2>
<h3 style="color: black;"> University is a Nigerian-based private learning institution driven by pan-African ideology. Ours is a story of resilience and comeback against all odds. We officially began operations in 2009 in GRA Benin-City Edo state. We currently offer 17 undergraduate courses across 4 colleges, as well as postgraduate courses. We are a vibrant community of multicultural staff and students from across Africa. Our institution is committed to the positive transformation of our immediate environment, country, and the world at large. Wellspring University provides a student learning experience that will build the mindset of African leadership for positive change.</h3><BR>

<background></background>
<h3  style="color: black;">The journey of Wellspring University has been anything but smooth. Since opening our doors to the public in 2010, the first decade was marked by a series of challenges, ranging from the mundane to the tumultuous. The period from 2020 to 2021 was especially pivotal. The Covid-19 pandemic came with its peculiar challenges in 2020 and in 2021, we lost our library to an electrical fire. The impact of these challenges listed above in addition to existing challenges we were facing put us on the verge of shutting down operations. But against all odds, we navigated through these challenges and survived this period. We embraced our survival as a gift we should not take for granted, and a second chance for a fresh start. This experience led us to reassess our core mission and our reason for existence by asking these three questions;</h3>
<center><h2  style="color: white;" style="text-align:center;"> Wellspring University Strategic Direction</h2></center>
<h3  style="color: black;">Our attempt to answer these questions led to the launch of the first version of our Strategic Direction in November 2021. You can view it here. The past few years of judiciously following our new vision have shown clear indications that we are on the right track as an institution, as this vision has sparked tremendous growth. The path we travelled can be likened to attending the school of hard knocks and graduating successfully. Our unique story of resilience is a testament to the tough times we endured, which have profoundly shaped our ideology and drive for the future. Our future at Wellspring University holds a lot of promise, for which we are really excited. We are looking forward to having you onboard with us. Start your journey here(apply now).</h3><br>

<h1 style="color: white;"  style="text-align: center;">The African Story: Our Vision and Mission</h1>
<H3>At Wellspring University, we firmly believe that the transformation of the African continent will be driven by education. This belief raises an important question: what will this type of education look like? There is a famous quote that states, “knowledge is power.” However, we boldly assert that true power lies with those who define the boundaries of knowledge. Our vision is to unlock Africa’s potential through learning by raising a generation of pan-African leaders who are equipped to make a difference from the global perspective. Wellspring University is not just a place of learning; it is a community dedicated to innovation, excellence, and providing lasting impact to society. We are committed to creating an environment where students can thrive, innovate, and lead with integrity.</H3>

<h3>At Wellspring University, we believe that innovation is not just about technology. We see innovation as doing things differently to achieve a better result. This has led to the birth of The Ubemilin Centre for Tomorrow (Wellspring University’s Innovation hub). The term Ubemilin is coined from the local Benin dialect meaning ‘to nurture’. The Ubemilin Centre for Tomorrow is Wellspring University’s intervention vehicle to nurture, manage and promote innovative thinking and initiatives. Here, we would birth social impact enterprises, entrepreneurial ideas, promote advocacy and leadership initiatives beyond the classroom.</h3>
